# Ephemeral Browser Development Tasks

## Project Overview
Windows WPF/.NET 8 application with WebView2 for ephemeral browsing containers with privacy-first features.

## Completed Tasks

### Initial Setup (2025-08-05)
- ✅ Create solution structure with proper project organization
- ✅ Set up Directory.Build.props for centralized build configuration
- ✅ Create core service interfaces (IUrlSanitizer, IProfileManager, IDownloadGate)
- ✅ Implement basic service implementations in EphemeralBrowser.Core
- ✅ Set up WPF application shell with MVVM architecture
- ✅ Create example implementations for reference

## Current Priority Tasks

### Core Browser Functionality
- ✅ Complete WebView2 integration in main application
- ✅ Implement ephemeral profile management with proper teardown
- ✅ Add URL sanitization with visual feedback (chip + undo)
- ✅ Integrate download gate with MOTW tagging
- ✅ Add anti-fingerprinting shims injection

### Recently Completed (2025-08-05)
- ✅ Created TabView UserControl for proper WebView2/ViewModel integration
- ✅ Connected TabViewModel to WebView2 with ephemeral profile environments
- ✅ Implemented URL sanitization with navigation interception
- ✅ Added privacy settings configuration and anti-fingerprinting shims
- ✅ Integrated download quarantine and MOTW tagging system

### UI/UX Implementation  
- ✅ Complete MainWindow XAML with tab management
- 📋 Create Privacy Panel for per-site policies
- 📋 Create Rules Panel for sanitizer configuration
- 📋 Create Diagnostics Panel for debug information
- 📋 Implement keyboard shortcuts and navigation

### Testing & Quality
- 📋 Set up unit tests with proper Windows targeting
- 📋 Add integration tests with Playwright for .NET
- 📋 Configure performance benchmarking
- 📋 Add security testing for MOTW and sanitization

## Development Environment Notes
- **Platform**: Windows-only (WPF + WebView2)
- **Current Issue**: Project requires Windows for WPF/WebView2 development
- **Build Command**: `dotnet build` (Windows only)
- **Test Command**: `dotnet test` (Windows only)

## Architecture Status
- ✅ Solution structure follows CLAUDE.md guidelines
- ✅ Service layer abstraction implemented
- ✅ MVVM pattern established
- ✅ WebView2 host integration complete
- ✅ Performance monitoring system implemented
- ✅ Security features (MOTW, sanitizer) implemented

## Next Steps
1. **TEST ON WINDOWS** - Build and run the application to verify integration works
2. Create Privacy Panel for per-site policy configuration
3. Create Rules Panel for sanitizer rule management
4. Create Diagnostics Panel for debugging and monitoring
5. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
6. Create comprehensive testing suite
7. Package for distribution (MSIX/MSI)

## Performance Targets
- Cold start: < 800ms
- Warm start: < 300ms
- First navigation overhead: < 150ms
- Memory per container: < 200MB
- Profile teardown: < 500ms
